# Welcome to Geography 370!

[Click here to get started!](https://amurraygeo.com/slides/intro_geographic_information/Day01/slides.html)

## A few quick points:

- This course will be asynchronous, which means that you will be responsible for viewing the lectures and completing the work on your own schedule.

- I will be available to talk with you one-on-one as needed throughout the course to help with issues along the way (and I am sure there will be many!) with weekly (virtual) office hours and by appointment.

- We are using advanced software for this class and we will need to navigate how to manage this as some of you will not have access to the software, or possibly a stable internet connection. I will do my best to help you navigate these obstacles.

## What to expect

## Materials

We will be using [Essentials of Geographic Information Systems](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/essentials-of-geographic-information-systems), which is a free and open source textbook.
