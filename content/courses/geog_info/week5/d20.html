<h2>Symbology and more data wrangling</h2>
<p>Todayâ€™s lecture will not include slides. Instead I am focusing this as a walktrhough where I will show you a few more tricks for getting data into ArcGIS Pro and using different types of Symbology. The lecture is posted as a recorded zoom lecture which will appear below by 11:30 A.M.</p>
<p>Please remember to submit your final project proposal to Sakai by tonight at midnight.</p>
