## Wrapping Up

This is the last actual day of classes as tomorrow is a reading day. Therefore today is the last day I will be posting new material. However you should be taking this time to work on your final projects and continue to post questions.

The lecture below covers a brief layout tutorial as well as an overview of web apps in ArcGIS Online. A reminder that you are not required to build a web app for your final project but they can be super useful and I hope you find their applications interesting for future projects.

Don't forget to take your final quiz on Sakai by Friday Night

### Your Final is due by 2:30 PM EST on Monday July 27!
