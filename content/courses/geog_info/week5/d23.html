<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>This is the last actual day of classes as tomorrow is a reading day. Therefore today is the last day I will be posting new material. However you should be taking this time to work on your final projects and continue to post questions.</p>
<p>The lecture below covers a brief layout tutorial as well as an overview of web apps in ArcGIS Online. A reminder that you are not required to build a web app for your final project but they can be super useful and I hope you find their applications interesting for future projects.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t forget to take your final quiz on Sakai by Friday Night</p>
