## Here are some resources for using the VCL

I am going to demo in windows, but if you are using a MAC, [CLICK HERE](/files/VCL_Mac_Setup.pdf) for instructions.

The Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) is essentially a remote computer that you can connect to at UNC in order to have access to specialty software and more computing power than you may have on your personal laptop. In order to use the VCL, you need to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to log into the UNC network. Essentially logging into the VPN makes it appear as though you are on campus, and therefore gives you access to all of the things you would normally have access to if you were on campus and logged into eduroam.

To log into the UNC VPN, you need to download the software that will let you do it. You can do that [HERE](https://uncch.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010155).

Once you have the Cisco AnyConnect software installed, you want to run it and connect to 'vpn.unc.edu'.

Once you click 'Connect' a second window will open with login options:

Here, you should select 'UNCCampus' for the Group, enter your onyen for Username, and you personal password for Password. For the second password, you need to obtain a 6-digit code from duo, which is a secondary authentication service we use at UNC. If you have not already set up duo, go [here](https://its.unc.edu/2-step/) to do so.

At this point, you should be able to connect, and you will receive a prompt to connect that looks like this:

Click 'Accept'.

You are now connected to the UNC vpn and we can get started with connecting to the VCL.
