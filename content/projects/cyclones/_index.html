<h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
<div class="line-block">      Geophysical landscape features, temporal variability of soil moisture, and land cover are major drivers of groundwater vulnerability to contamination. Extreme precipitation events such as <strong>tropical cyclones overwhelm and impose changes to each of these variables in measurable ways</strong>. Investigating the relationships and the ways in which to measure these impacts will enable future forecasting of vulnerability and better inform disaster response efforts, directly and positively affecting human health.</div>
