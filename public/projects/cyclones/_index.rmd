Flooding in Chapel Hill after Hurricane Florence

## Hypothesis:

|       Geophysical landscape features, temporal variability of soil moisture, and land cover are major drivers of groundwater vulnerability to contamination. Extreme precipitation events such as **tropical cyclones overwhelm and impose changes to each of these variables in measurable ways**. Investigating the relationships and the ways in which to measure these impacts will enable future forecasting of vulnerability and better inform disaster response efforts, directly and positively affecting human health.
