<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 2</span> Introduction</h1>
<div class="line-block">      In the past five years, twenty tropical cyclones have made landfall in the southeastern United States, many with devastating impacts in areas that are heavily dependent on groundwater. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew broke more than 14 peak streamflow records, drowning thousands of hogs and millions of chickens and turkeys while overwhelming waste lagoons that spilled into local waterways that reached groundwater systems (<span class="citation">Robbins (<a href="#ref-robbins2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> &amp; <span class="citation">Porter (<a href="#ref-porter2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). More than 2,200 community water systems and over 1,700 wastewater facilities were compromised by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, including a reported half-billion-gallon spill of industrial wastewater which mixed with storm water and surged out of a single chemical plant <span class="citation">(Bajak <a href="#ref-bajak2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. In 2018, Hurricanes Florence and Michael collectively impacted Florida, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, bringing new examples of floodwaters that continued to rise well after the rains had ended, compromising hog and poultry farms, chemical plants, and vast expanses of agricultural areas. Tropical Storm Imelda (2019) dropped up to 950 mm of rain in some areas <span class="citation">(Edmund and Bell <a href="#ref-R-prism" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, showing that devastating flooding is not limited to those storms labeled as ‘hurricanes.’ In fact, most of the coastal southeastern United States has experienced intense rainfall from a tropical cyclone at least once in the past five years <a href="intro.html#fig:ppt">Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:ppt">2.1</a></a>. In the aftermath of extreme precipitation events, emergency responders, or researchers, often provide free or discounted water testing to well owners. While public water utilities are required to conduct regular testing of water supplies by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), private water supplies are not protected under the SDWA and are therefore not subject to testing requirements; they are thus more susceptible to undetected contamination of drinking water. Consequently, the burden of testing drinking water falls on the homeowner or tenant who may not suspect that their water has been contaminated. The factors most closely associated with a person’s judgment of their water quality are taste followed by odor and color <span class="citation">(Franca Doria <a href="#ref-defranca2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, but many contaminants are known to pose serious threats to human health at levels low enough to have no effect on taste, odor, or color. For example, benzene, a carcinogenic component of gasoline, has an EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of .005 mg/L and a residence time in groundwater approaching thirty years <span class="citation">(Molson et al. <a href="#ref-molson2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. Consequently, it is important to understand and assess groundwater vulnerability without depending on the information provided by individual homeowners.</div>

<p>Currently, we have no way of estimating groundwater vulnerability to contamination following extreme precipitation events. Reports in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew showed that soil saturation and precipitation in the 45 days prior to the storm amplified peak stream flows and the inundation extent during and after the storm<span class="citation">(Musser, Watson, and Gotvald <a href="#ref-musser2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. It should be noted that while the bulk of attention is given to major hurricanes, there is no correlation between wind speed (storm category) and either precipitation intensity or mean precipitation over land <a href="intro.html#fig:stormPts">Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:stormPts">2.2</a></a>. Analytical complications are introduced by variability in land cover, which is known to directly affect soil water infiltration rates during and after rainfall events. In urban areas with variable density of impervious surface cover, infiltration rates can vary by up to 60% over small spatial scales<span class="citation">(Pauleit and Duhme <a href="#ref-pauleit2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>, while in undeveloped land infiltration rates can vary between &lt; .1 to &gt; 10 m / day<span class="citation">(Bouwer <a href="#ref-bouwer1999" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>. I seek to provide quantitative understanding of the vulnerability of groundwater resources to contamination during and after extreme precipitation events, using temporal changes in soil moisture (SM) in the days prior to and following an event and in combination with land use/land cover information. My research will utilize both passive and active satellite based and sub-orbital airborne sensors, in conjunction with established sources of geologic and atmospheric information.</p>

Figure 2.2: Wind speed at landfall plotted against maximum total rainfall experienced at a single point per cyclone event and colored by average mean precipitation experienced over the impacted land area

I propose to utilize L, C and X band sensors producing SM data in combination with land cover and a tried-and-true groundwater vulnerability indexing method to predict groundwater areas prone to contact with surface waters, and thus predict those most vulnerable to contamination from extreme events. My previous work at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has shown that North Carolina, Florida, and Texas have the first, second, and fifth highest populations served by private domestic groundwater wells in the nation, respectively<span class="citation">(Murray et al. <a href="#ref-murray2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. More than five million privately owned wells have been impacted by tropical cyclones since 2015 <a href="intro.html#fig:pptWellsBar">Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:pptWellsBar">2.3</a></a>. The Southeastern U.S. has high reliance on private water supplies, yet also displays heterogenous land use types and varying physical landscapes. For example, Houston is characterized by heavily urbanized and industrial landscapes, largely dominated by the oil and gas sector. The Florida coast represents low lying wetland landscapes heavily susceptible to groundwater contamination due to the prevalence of limestone. The eastern Carolinas are characterized by mixed rural and urban landscapes with a large portion of the economy built on agriculture, specifically intensive hog and poultry farming, highlighting the risk for agricultural contaminants to reach groundwater systems.<br />

<p>With recent developments in remotely sensed SM data products from multiple active and passive sensors using L, C and X bands, it is possible to create global coverage SM maps with high spatial resolution<span class="citation">(Mohanty et al. <a href="#ref-mohanty2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. This information can be used to evaluate the temporal variability in hydraulic parameters such as conductivity and water retention(<span class="citation">Ahuja, Wendroth, and Nielsen (<a href="#ref-ahuja1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span> &amp; <span class="citation">Chen et al. (<a href="#ref-chen1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>). The SM Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, equipped with a radiometer for passive L band (40 km2 resolution) and C band radar is used to produce a Level 4 SM data product (9 km resolution) quantifying daily SM measurements<span class="citation">(Reichle et al. <a href="#ref-reichle2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Although the C band radar on SMAP failed two months after launch, recent work has been completed to assimilate the SMAP passive radiometer with Sentinel 1A and 1B active radar data (<span class="citation">Das et al. (<a href="#ref-das2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> &amp; <span class="citation">Santi et al. (<a href="#ref-santi2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>), which is shown to outperform SMAP passive data alone when compared to in situ data measurements <span class="citation">(Lievens et al. <a href="#ref-lievens2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
