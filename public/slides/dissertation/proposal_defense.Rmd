## .center[Cyclone Precipitation a Function of Windspeed?]

.pull-left[
####<br> - There is no correlation between storm windspeed and either rainfall distribution or intensity

####<br> - Try to predict **max** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: $p = .25$ / $r^{2}=.019$

####<br> - Try to predict **mean** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: $p=.06$ / $r^{2}=.065$

So why to we obsess over storm category when the real danger lies in the water?
