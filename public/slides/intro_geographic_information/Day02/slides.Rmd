### Everything has a place...

.med[
- Everything exists in space

- Understanding the 'where' helps us understand the what/when/how

- However, 'where' is just the starting point.

### GIS...

- Allows us to leverage location into an infinite number of applications

- The last few decades have seen GIS technologies evolve exponentially

- A simple spatial analysis that took an hour ten years ago takes only seconds now

If you signed up for this class then I can only assume that you have an interest in the role that location plays in our everyday lives. From designing the layout of a grocery store to planning a city to understanding global climate change, geography and GIS is everywhere.

### Where did GIS start?

.med[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 200, out.width= 200}
knitr::include_graphics("snow.PNG")
```

John Snow

- Epidemiologist
- 1854 Cholera outbreak in London
- 616 people killed
- Cholera was thought to spread through the air
- Snow's map lead to the discovery that it was actually the water

## Mental Maps

.med[
In chapter 1 we read about mental maps.

- When you give directions, do you use North / East / South /West?
  - Do you use landmarks?

- If you asked everyone in your family to draw a mpa of your neighborhood, would they look the same?

### Mental Maps vs 'real' maps

.mb[
- Mental maps are how we reproduce our view of reality
  - They are unique to each individual
  
- When we use GIS to create maps, we use geometry to duplicate real-world positions of people/places/things etc...

  - At it's core, GIS is all about geometry... shapes / distances / relative locations...

## Location

.pull-left[
### What is location?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 350, out.width= 300}
knitr::include_graphics("oldwell.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
.med[

**The Old well is located at:**

- 35.912050 degrees north, 79.051237 degrees west.
- On East Cameron Ave.
- Chapel Hill
- Orange County
- Earth...

### These are all correct...

The earth is a

### The old well is an example of a place which can be accurately represented by a single point.

**What about...?**
.med[
- the Rocky Mountains

- The Mississippi river

- The Atlantic Ocean

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 350, out.width= 300}
knitr::include_graphics("rockies.png")

The google maps location of the Rocky mountains

### Global Positioning System

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 450, out.width= 450}
knitr::include_graphics("gps.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[
.mb[
- A set of 24 sattelites in constant orbit around the earth.

- Linking to at least **three** of them can give you a location on the planet

- Linking to **four** gives you altitude as well

### Direction
.med[
The three norths

- Magnetic North
- True North
- Grid North

For most maps we use true north as the benchmark for direction.

However, we can also use landmarks as benchmarks
  - The movie theater is two blocks north of city hall

### Distance
.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 350, out.width= 550}
knitr::include_graphics("greatcircle.png")
```

]

.pull-right[
.med[
- We measure distance all sorts of ways
  - Miles
  - Kilometers
  - Days
  - Number of flights

- What is the shortest distance?
  - straight line
  - great circle route

### Space
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 200, out.width= 300}
knitr::include_graphics("underground.jpg")

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 250, out.width= 300}

```

.med[
*Space* might be the most ambiguous term we use in geography. 

- Space can refer to anything from a classroom to the universe (multiverse?)

- But typically we are talking about topological space 

*topological space is concerned with the nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within a given space.*

### Navigation
.pull-left[
*Navigation is the destination-oriented movement through space.*

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height= 250, out.width= 300}

- Modern network routing!

- Getting to the grocery store!
