## Outline
- What is hydrology?
- Conservation of mass and energy
- The hydrologic cycle
- Distribution of Water on Earth
- Observations

## Hydrology (Water Science)
### Study of the occurrence, circulation, and distribution of the water of the earth and its atmosphere
- The global hydrologic cycle:
  - Terrestrial
  - Oceanic
  - Atmospheric
- The land phase of the hydrologic cycle:
  - Water on and under the earth’s surface
  - Physical, chemical, biological processes

## Mass and Energy
- Principle of Conservation of Mass
  - Anthony Lavoisier: “Mass of the Reactants = Mass of the Products”

- Law of Conservation of Energy
  - Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but 	can be transformed (Galileo’s pendulum test)

## Water Use in the United States
The U.S. Geological Survey tracks water use (to the best of their abilities) for the country. Check out their report [HERE](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/water-use-united-states?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

## Humans **did not** just start modifying the landscape to our advantage

- 5,000-6,000 YBP, Hydraulic structures (canals, wells, etc.) in Pakistan, Mesopotamia, China & Egypt.

- 3,800 YBP, Egyptians monitor river flow.


- 3,000 YPB, Solomon’s concept of the hydrologic cycle – “All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.”

- 753 BC - 1461 AD, Romans use hydraulics to construct extensive aqueduct system.

## Historically…
>- 1,500, Leonardo da Vinci (Italy) - “ water in rivers comes from rain, constantly circulating and returning.”

>- 1,670-80s, Perrault & Marriotte - Modern approach – published measurements that quantified rainfall and as origin of stream flow.

>- 1750, Term “hydrology” first used

>- 1856, Henry Darcy’s work on flow through porous material - groundwater flow equation.

>- 1862, Nathanial Beard’s “Manual of Hydrology”
  - **Rainfall -> Streamflow**

## Hisotrically cont'd...

>- 1904, Daniel Mead’s text in hydrology for civil engineers.

>- 1922, International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics “Scientific Hydrology Section” formed.

>- 1930, Birth of American Geophysical Union “Hydrology Section”

>- Mid 1900s – present, Hazen, Langbein - statistics; Meinzer, Theis, Hubbert - groundwater theory; Von Karman, Chow, Gilbert - stream hydraulics; Horton & Leopold - runoff; Thornthwaite & Penman - ET; Wolman & Garrels - water quality. 

## Moving into Modern Times

>- **1850-1960s:** Environmental concerns, e.g., Cuyahoga River

>- **1972:** Clean Water Act
>- **1974:** Safe Drinking Water Act
>- **Late 1900s-2000:** Drinking water issues
>- **2015:** WOTUS

## Types of Hydrology
- Chemical hydrology
- Ecohydrology
- Vadose zone hydrology
- Hydrogeology
- Hydrometeorology
- Limnology
- Surface hydrology

## A Cautionary Tale of Simplification
“We must be aware that an understanding of the basic physics of such processes as evaporation, snowmelt, and infiltration as they occur instantaneously at a given point does not always extrapolate easily to an understanding of the hydrology of a finite area, such as a drainage basin, over a finite time.” (Dingman, 2002)

### WHY?
(1) Hydrologic quantities and the factors that control them vary greatly in space and time (temporal/spatial heterogeneity).  It is both difficult and expensive/impossible to make measurements over such large scales.

(2) Rates of water movement are nonlinear functions of the controlling quantities: “the whole is different from the sum of the pieces”

## Water Balance Concept (Conservation of Mass!){width=600px}
![]{/img/waterbalance.img}
### Inputs = Outputs ± Change in Storage

## Open vs. Closed Systems
The hydrologic cycle is an open system (open to energy)

- Instances can be considered closed systems

The problem is that we erroneously think of the hydrologic cycle independent of the energy balance.

- But how are the water cycle and the terrestrial energy balance related? 

## Land Phase of the Water Cycle

## Water Balance Parameters
### Inputs

- Precipitation
  - Rain
  - Snow/Ice
  - Fog/Mist
Surface Runoff
  - Runoff (Overland Flow)
  - Soil Water (interflow)
Groundwater

  - Leaf/Plant Surfaces
- Transpiration
- Surface Water
  - Runoff (overland flow)
