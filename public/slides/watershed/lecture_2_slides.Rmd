## Outline
- What is hydrology?
- Conservation of mass and energy
- The hydrologic cycle
- Distribution of Water on Earth
- Observations

## Hydrology (Water Science)
### Study of the occurrence, circulation, and distribution of the water of the earth and its atmosphere
- The global hydrologic cycle:
  - Terrestrial
  - Oceanic
  - Atmospheric
- The land phase of the hydrologic cycle:
  - Water on and under the earth’s surface
  - Physical, chemical, biological processes

## Mass and Energy
- Principle of Conservation of Mass
  - Anthony Lavoisier: “Mass of the Reactants = Mass of the Products”

- Law of Conservation of Energy
  - Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but 	can be transformed (Galileo’s pendulum test)

## Water Use in the United States
The U.S. Geological Survey tracks water use (to the best of their abilities) for the country. Check out their report [HERE](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/water-use-united-states?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

## Humans **did not** just start modifying the landscape to our advantage

- 5,000-6,000 YBP, Hydraulic structures (canals, wells, etc.) in Pakistan, Mesopotamia, China & Egypt.

- 3,800 YBP, Egyptians monitor river flow.


- 3,000 YPB, Solomon’s concept of the hydrologic cycle – “All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.”

- 753 BC - 1461 AD, Romans use hydraulics to construct extensive aqueduct system.
