</div>

**From Hornberger et al., 1998:** “An area of land in which water flowing across the land surface drains into a particular stream or river and ultimately flows through a single point or outlet on that stream or river.”



### What's Wrong with this Definition?

> - It ignores ET
> - Does not always apply to groundwater
> - Hard to apply across all systems, e.g., ‘windsheds’

## 'Traditional' Watersheds?

- Watersheds are not all the same and should not be treated as such
- When we think of watersheds we immediately think of steep hill slopes feeding into flood plains / rivers / oceans etc... but this is not always the case
