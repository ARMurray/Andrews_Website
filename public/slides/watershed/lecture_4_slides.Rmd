### Watershed Definition Revisited

</div>

**From Hornberger et al., 1998:** “An area of land in which water flowing across the land surface drains into a particular stream or river and ultimately flows through a single point or outlet on that stream or river.”



### What's Wrong with this Definition?

> - It ignores ET
> - Does not always apply to groundwater
> - Hard to apply across all systems, e.g., ‘windsheds’

## 'Traditional' Watersheds?

</div>

- Watersheds are not all the same and should not be treated as such
- When we think of watersheds we immediately think of steep hill slopes feeding into flood plains / rivers / oceans etc... but this is not always the case


## “This is the Sand Hills; you’re only two weeks away from the next drought.”

## The Divide

## REMEMBER!... The Watershed Concept is Based on Surface Water

- Groundwater table divides beneath the watershed DO NOT ALWAYS mimic surface water divides.

- Groundwater MAY NOT leave the watershed via the stream “cross-section”
  - How else might it get out?

## Characterizing Smaller Watersheds
At the scale of small watersheds where measurements are lacking, ‘watershed area’ is often used to compare spatial patterns of soil water content.
