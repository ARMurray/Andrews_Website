<div class="line-block">      I will start with an established groundwater vulnerability index and update it using SM products, precipitation, landcover, and LAI, while also leveraging new technologies to supply dynamic hydrogeological data to better calibrate existing variables. I will evaluate the SMAP L4 Surface and Root Zone SM (9 km), SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 Radiometer/Radar SM data (3 km) and SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer Daily SM (9 km) products for use within this new, dynamic vulnerability index. Changes in LAI will be assessed pre- and post-event to determine changes in permeability values utilizing accepted methods leveraging MODIS data <span class="citation">(Song <a href="#ref-song2013optical" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. LCLU will also be considered via the National Land Cover Dataset. This information will be used to parameterize a DRASTIC vulnerability index <span class="citation">(Aller et al. <a href="#ref-aller1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, amply used in hydrological research (<span class="citation">H.Hamza et al. (<a href="#ref-hamza2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Jang et al. (<a href="#ref-jang2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Panagopoulos, Antonakos, and Lambrakis (<a href="#ref-panagopoulos2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Remesan and Panda (<a href="#ref-remesan2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Rundquist et al.

DRASTIC is a ranking scheme that uses a combination of weights consisting of <strong>D</strong>epth to water table, net <strong>R</strong>echarge, <strong>A</strong>quifer media, <strong>S</strong>oil media, <strong>T</strong>opography, <strong>I</strong>mpact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic <strong>C</strong>onductivity of the aquifer. A spatially distributed DRASTIC index will be calculated using static variables which are readily available and updated using land cover and daily parameters calculated from remotely sensed SM data. Results will be assessed to characterize the spatial variability of vulnerability of groundwater systems surrounding extreme precipitation events.</div>
<div class="line-block">      Currently, the best method for estimating SM at an optimal combination of spatial and temporal resolution is the SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9 km group of products which show that while the patterns of SM increase closely align with precipitation, landscape is much more spatially complex <a href="methods.html#fig:florence">Figure <a href="methods.html#fig:florence">4.1</a></a>. The SMAP/Sentinel L2 3km SM product which further refines spatial resolution and enhance forecasting ability <span class="citation">(Das et al. <a href="#ref-das2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, but comes at the cost of temporal resolution. The newer L2 3km assimilated product yields global coverage every ~12 days as opposed to every 1.5 days for 9km data. Multiple SM measurements will be used to cross validate SMAP data such as NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) mission, which was flown multiple times following Hurricane Harvey over Houston and Hurricane Florence over the Carolinas. These data will aid in validating models of SM response across various land cover types post-storm by measuring performance against the SMAP/Sentinel data products as inputs to the groundwater vulnerability index. Additionally, this work will leverage and complement the SM Viewer (SMV) maintained by NASA’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Data Archive Center, which collects available SM data from a variety of remotely sensed and in-situ sources <span class="citation">(Shrestha and Boyer <a href="#ref-shrestha2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</div>

<div class="line-block">      The DRASTIC index, developed in 1987 by the National Groundwater Well Association and U.S. EPA heavily realies on subsurface geologic variables and typically uses data collected over extended periods of time to calculate ‘normal’ index values for a specific location. Groundwater vulnerability, however, is not static and can fluctuate depending on current conditions relating to saturation level of the soil, seasonality, weather conditions and land cover. An improvement upon the DRASTIC index is needed to understand how vulnerability fluctuates prior and in response to extreme weather events in order to estimate regions vulnerable to groundwater contamination and to better inform the public, emergency response efforts and future research.</div>
<div class="line-block">      Input data for aquifer and soil media, topography, and vadose zone impact are available nationally from the USDA SSURGO database and the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Water table height can be estimated using a combination of publicly available USGS groundwater well data and well drilling records. Net recharge and hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using a combination of geologic properties and SM data when collected over time (with temporal SMAP/Sentinel data). Further, conductivity and recharge are two of the most important variables for estimating contamination vulnerability in this method <span class="citation">(Babiker et al. <a href="#ref-babiker2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>. Utilizing DRASTIC along with cutting edge SM mapping methods, I will determine the relationships between extreme precipitation events on groundwater vulnerability and how that vulnerability is affected by varying land use and geophysical features. For example, data from SMAP, Sentinel-1, SSURGO, and historical well drilling logs can be combined to estimate the vertical position of the water table along the gulf and east coasts prior to landfall of a major hurricane with real time forecasting. The index will further benefit from inputs from the SPoRT-MODIS Vegetation Product, a vegetation index calculated daily, which will better inform a landscape’s capacity for water uptake prior to a major rain event. I will then leverage other current information and modeling systems such as NASAs Realtime Land Information System (Real-time LIS), a collection of weather models which are run daily for the southeastern U.S. (3 km2 resolution). EPAs Enforcement and Compliance History (ECHO) will add information on permitted facilities storing hazardous materials to forecast potential for contamination. I propose to create SM maps at regular intervals (1-3 days) pre and post-event landfall for ~60 days surrounding each of the tropical cyclones. Based on these SM maps and added inputs such as precipitation and geologic data, I will calculate soil saturation and drying rates, and then net recharge for input into DRASTIC. A DRASTIC index will be calculated for each of the SM collection dates pre and post-event landfall and analyzed for changes impacted by variation in SM. Land use will be evaluated as an additional input variable for DRASTIC by determining the relationships between land use types and facilitation of or obstruction to groundwater infiltration (i.e. paved surfaces in urban areas restricting infiltration, unmanaged sawgrass facilitating uptake etc). Once final estimates for vulnerability are completed, I will assess them against existing water quality data taken following extreme precipitation events. My lab has been directly involved in two projects that collected water samples and water quality information immediately after Hurricane Matthew and during peak flood during Hurricane Florence, and we are actively collaborating with other research groups at UNC’s Institute for the Environment and NC State University who have conducted private well tests numbering in the thousands following major cyclones such as Matthew, Florence and Michael.</div>

<div id="soil-moisture" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Soil Moisture</h3>
<div class="line-block">      I plan to investigate the relationships between soil moisture change and land cover. The simplest approach to this problem is to create variables from the SMAP data set for wetting and drying. I define ‘wetting’ <a href="methods.html#eq:wetting">(4.1)</a> as the increase in soil moisture from the day before landfall to peak soil moisture.</div>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:wetting">\[\begin{equation} 
  SM_{w} = SM_{p} - SM_{Lf-1}
  \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> = wetting, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = peak soil moisture during the storm period and <span class="math inline">\(Lf\)</span> = day the storm made landfall. Conversely, ‘drying’ <a href="methods.html#eq:drying">(4.2)</a> is the decrease in soil moisture between the peak and minimum soil moistures x days from landfall.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:drying">\[\begin{equation} 
  SM_{d} = SM_{p} - SM_{min[p,Lf+x]}
  \tag{4.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Data are available for twenty tropical cyclones, which have made landfall in the southeastern United States since the launch of SMAP in 2015. These twenty storms have impacted almost the entire coastline stretching from Texas through North Carolina, allowing us to conduct analyses over a wide swath of space and landscape types. The simplest way to try and correlate land use, wetting and drying rates will be to calculate dominant land use category from the NLCD for each SMAP pixel. This approach is demonstrated in <a href="hypothesis.html#fig:boxPlot">Figure <a href="hypothesis.html#fig:boxPlot">3.1</a></a>. However, with their being roughly 900 NLCD pixels within a single SMAP pixel, the need to go deeper using a form of multinomial statistics or by clustering SMAP pixels based on NLCD composition may be necessary. Additionally, LAI will be tested against both wetting and drying.</p>
</div>
<div id="land-cover-imperviousness-vegetation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Land Cover / Imperviousness / Vegetation</h3>
<div class="line-block">      It is clear that vegetation plays an important role in the handling of precipitation, especially with respect to extreme precipitation events. For example, many have pointed to the historic flooding experienced in Houston, not just as a result of Hurricane Harvey, but over the past two decades. An estimated 30% of freshwater wetlands were lost in Harris county between 1992 and 2003 which is a fact many point to when describing how the intense flooding Harvey brought could have been partially offset <span class="citation">(Satija <a href="#ref-satija2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Much of Houston’s urban sprawl has claimed thousands of acres of prairie grass that would have otherwise helped absorb some of the blow from extreme precipitation events. These concepts come into play through hydraulic head and preferential pathways between the surface and subsurface. Under normal conditions, plant roots provide these preferential pathways since they have a higher hydraulic conductivity than unsaturated soil <span class="citation">(Caldwell and Richards <a href="#ref-caldwell1989hydraulic" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span>. Hydraulic lift can occur when the surface soil is much drier than the subsurface due to the differential hydraulic head. This means that normally, during the day water can be brought to the surface, and at night, water can be deposited into the subsurface via the preferential pathways offered by vegetation <span class="citation">(Hornberger et al. <a href="#ref-hornberger2014elements" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Thus, when an extreme precipitation event occurs, if the subsurface is unsaturated and dense vegetation exists, water can be rapidly moved into the subsurface, decreasing total runoff. This of course is heavily dependent on vegetation type and root depth, which must be considered.</div>
<p>While I have established that vegetation, among other things, is a key driver of infiltration rates, it is important to consider how dynamic of a driver it is. The presence of vegetation by itself does not define infiltration. While regional vegetation patterns are relatively consistent accross the coastal southeastern United States <span class="citation">(Mills et al. <a href="#ref-mills2013identification" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, specific vegetation types can vary greatly accross local spatial scales</p>
<div class="line-block">      Ecosystem maturity must also be considered. Plant maturity and density is of importance when considering this. The National Landcover Dataset is a good example for this point, as it may show identical landuse types across space, but may not reveal other important variables such as LAI. For example, the free throughfall coefficient of precipitation is a direct exponential function of LAI <span class="citation">(Pitman <a href="#ref-pitman1989rainfall" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span>. As infiltration and surface runoff rates are, by their nature, controlled first by interception, an ecosystem’s progression in succession may have a significant impact on interflow and runoff. Thus, land cover / land use change may have a similar effect but with even more complexity involved relating to root depth, root type etc… Similarly, it should be pointed out that while succession changes year-to-year, intra-seasonal factors must also be considered. Plants need oxygen at their roots and that oxygen is obtained by diffusion through pores in the soil <span class="citation">(Hornberger et al. <a href="#ref-hornberger2014elements" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Therefore, if the soil is oversaturated, the plant may die. There are certainly exceptions to this rule. Sedges such as sawgrass, which are prevalent in the everglades, are capable of spending over a year completely submerged in water without dying off.</div>
</div>
<div id="contexualizing-vulnearbility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Contexualizing Vulnearbility</h3>
<div class="line-block">      To this point, vulnerability has been referred to in a physical sense. This is to say that contaminants obey the laws of physics and are not biased towards any one people. However, it is essential that I consider vulnerability in the context of those who may be affected by it. While contaminants do not discriminate, those who control their locations certainly might. It is well understood that point source contaminants are more likely to be found in areas of lower income communities. It may also be the case that areas in close proximity to point source contaminants are more likely to use well water, although that analysis has not been completed yet. Therefore we must consider both where people are relaint on wells in the context of contamination and also where people are more likely to be able to conduct proper testing and/or invest in advanced water filtration.</div>
