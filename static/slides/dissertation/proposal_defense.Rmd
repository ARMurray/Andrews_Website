####<br> - There is no correlation between storm windspeed and either rainfall distribution or intensity

####<br> - Try to predict **max** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: $p = .25$ / $r^{2}=.019$

####<br> - Try to predict **mean** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: $p=.06$ / $r^{2}=.065$

So why do we obsess over storm category when the real danger lies in the water?

- Connectivity
- What data is available... here it is public water utilities in Harris County, ER visits

.pull-left[### Studies are only as good as their data...

- I estimate that over **60 million people** in the United States obtain their water from privately owned, 'domestic' wells.


### This is important because...

- We still don't fully understand where all of these wells are
  - Public Utilities don't disclose service areas
  - Even if they did, there are over 150,000<br><br>
- Private Wells are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act
  - Very few testing requirements
  - Contamination sources are often unknown
]

???
So we know that increased rainfall is linked to increased risk of getting sick from water
But what do we not know?

## Main Points

--

- ### Extreme Precipitation &#8594; Increase in Waterborne Disease
--

- ### Extreme Precipitation does not necesarrily come from Hurricanes
  - But Tropical cyclones, in general, bring extreme precipitation to the southeastern U.S. and we have a lot of data for them
--

- ### 16.5% of the United States gets water from wells
  - Most people do not test their wells regularly
--

- ### It is important to understand where people are at risk of waterborne disease

The DRASTIC Index was a big project completed by the National groundwater well association and EPA in 1983.

- It has largely gone unchanged since it's creation
- It assumes conditions are static.
- It ignores potentially significant inputs

- Aquifer Media
- Soil Media
- Vadose Zone
- Topography

Data I need to create:

- Depth to Water Table
- Rate of Recharge
- Hydraulic Conductivity
]]

.pull-right[
.med[Probably Missing from the DRASTIC Index:

- Land Cover / Land Use
  - NLCD
  - Imperviousness
- Advanced Topography
  - Slope
  - Contributing Area
- Spatial Characterization of Vegetation
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI)
- Antecedent Soil Moisture Conditions
]]

---

### <br>Hypothesis:

<br><br>.med[Geophysical landscape features, temporal variability of soil moisture, and land cover are major drivers of groundwater vulnerability to contamination. Extreme precipitation events such as **tropical cyclones overwhelm and impose changes to each of these variables in measurable ways**. Investigating the relationships and the ways in which to measure these impacts will enable future forecasting of vulnerability and better inform disaster response efforts, directly and positively affecting human health.]

---

### Research Goal: Establish an updated index for groundwater vulnerability, which is dynamic and more inclusive of both physical and social factors present in the southeastern United States.
