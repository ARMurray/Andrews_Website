Maximum precipitation greater than 100 mm experienced during a single tropical cyclone event since the start of the 2015 tropical cyclone season.

- Notice that landfalls range from May to late October

- Here we only consider the maximum, so what this map is not showing is the recurrence of impacts (How many times places were hit)

## .center[Cyclone Precipitation a Function of Wind speed?]

.pull-left[
####&lt;br&gt; - There is no correlation between storm wind speed and either rainfall distribution or intensity

####&lt;br&gt; - Try to predict **max** rainfall from wind speed at landfall: `\(p = .25\)` / `\(r^{2}=.019\)`

####&lt;br&gt; - Try to predict **mean** rainfall from wind speed at landfall: `\(p=.06\)` / `\(r^{2}=.065\)`

So why do we obsess over storm category when the real danger lies in the water?

- Connectivity
- What data is available... here it is public water utilities in Harris County, ER visits
- We're really talking about two things here:
  - Public vs private systems
  - groundwater vs surface water

.pull-left[### Studies are only as good as their data...

- I estimate that over **60 million people** in the United States obtain their water from privately owned, 'domestic' wells.


### This is important because...

- We still don't fully understand where all of these wells are
  - Public Utilities don't disclose service areas
  - Even if they did, there are over 150,000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Private Wells are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act
  - Very few testing requirements
  - Contamination sources are often unknown

So we know that increased rainfall is linked to increased risk of getting sick from water
But what do we not know?

- Studies in the past have been restricted in their data

Notice the distribution of wells across the east coast. Areas at risk of impacts of tropical cyclones are heavily reliant on well water

### In fact, five of the top ten states in the U.S. in terms of well numbers are in the southeast

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Estimated private wells in areas impacted by greater than 100mm of precipitation in a single event. Only tropical cyclone events since 2015 considered here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

???
I calculated precipitation across census block groups

- The earlier map, was essentially laid on top of well estimates at the block group level

---

## Main Points

- ### Extreme Precipitation &amp;#8594; Increase in Waterborne Disease
  - Increased Connectivity means more pathways for contaminants
--

- ### Extreme Precipitation does not necessarily come from Hurricanes
  - But Tropical cyclones, in general, bring extreme precipitation to the southeastern U.S. and we have a lot of data for them
--

- ### 16.5% of the United States gets water from wells
  - Most people do not test their wells regularly
--

- ### If we can estimate where people are at higher risk, maybe we can prevent some of them from getting sick

The DRASTIC Index was a big project completed by the National groundwater well association and EPA in 1983.

- It has largely gone unchanged since it's creation
- It assumes conditions are static.
- It ignores potentially significant inputs

- Soil Media
- Vadose Zone

Data I need to create:

- Rate of Recharge
- Hydraulic Conductivity

.med[Probably Missing from the DRASTIC Index:

- Land Cover / Land Use
  - NLCD
  - Imperviousness
- Advanced Topography
  - Slope
  - Contributing Area
- Spatial Characterization of Vegetation
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI)
- Antecedent Soil Moisture Conditions
]]

### &lt;br&gt;Hypothesis:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.med[Geophysical landscape features, temporal variability of soil moisture, and land cover are major drivers of groundwater vulnerability to contamination. Extreme precipitation events such as **tropical cyclones overwhelm and impose changes to each of these variables in measurable ways**. Investigating the relationships and the ways in which to measure these impacts will enable future forecasting of vulnerability and better inform disaster response efforts, directly and positively affecting human health.]

---

### Research Goal: Establish an updated index for groundwater vulnerability, which is dynamic and more inclusive of both physical and social factors present in the southeastern United States.

.med[ The common denominator for much of this work is soil moisture:

Soil Moisture, along with other common data sources can be used to calculate:
- Recharge (Rushton et al., 2006)
- Hydraulic conductivity (Vereecken et al., 1990)

This has not been attempted at regional scales using SMAP]

## Summary:

.big[
- Extreme precipitation leads to waterborne illness
- Improvement on a dated vulnerability index is needed
- Substantial data is available for the establishment of relationships between landscape and extreme precipitation
  - I have shown here that relationships exist
- The success of this research may help in response efforts to extreme precipitation events and benefit public health
- I am capable of conducting this research
]

## Next Steps:

.big[On to Chapter 1:]

.med[
- I have shown preliminary analyses for Hurricane Florence.
  - These will need to be done for the other 19 cyclones
- Generation of variables for statistical testing:
  - Leaf Area Index
  - Topographical variables
      - Slope
      - Contributing Area
      - Aspect
  - Imperviousness
  - Various drying rates (Sensitivity Analysis for optimal drying times)
