## .center[Cyclone Precipitation a Function of Windspeed?]

.pull-left[
####&lt;br&gt; - There is no correlation between storm windspeed and either rainfall distribution or intensity

####&lt;br&gt; - Try to predict **max** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: `\(p = .25\)` / `\(r^{2}=.019\)`

####&lt;br&gt; - Try to predict **mean** rainfall from windspeed at landfall: `\(p=.06\)` / `\(r^{2}=.065\)`

So why do we obsess over storm category when the real danger lies in the water?

- Connectivity
- What data is available... here it is public water utilities in Harris County, ER visits

.pull-left[### Studies are only as good as their data...

- I estimate that over **60 million people** in the United States obtain their water from privately owned, 'domestic' wells.


### This is important because...

- We still don't fully understand where all of these wells are
  - Public Utilities don't disclose service areas
  - Even if they did, there are over 150,000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Private Wells are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act
  - Very few testing requirements
  - Contamination sources are often unknown
]

???
So we know that increased rainfall is linked to increased risk of getting sick from water
But what do we not know?

## Main Points

--

- ### Extreme Precipitation &amp;#8594; Increase in Waterborne Disease
--

- ### Extreme Precipitation does not necesarrily come from Hurricanes
  - But Tropical cyclones, in general, bring extreme precipitation to the southeastern U.S. and we have a lot of data for them
--

- ### 16.5% of the United States gets water from wells
  - Most people do not test their wells regularly
--

- ### It is important to understand where people are at risk of waterborne disease

---
class: center, middle

## Soil Moisture Change from SMAP:
**Hurricane Florence:**
