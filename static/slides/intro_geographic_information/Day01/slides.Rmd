## This is a test of the audio features

- This audio is from the internet

<audio controls>
  <source src="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/misc/dio_killing_the_dragon.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/misc/dio_killing_the_dragon.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>
</audio>


.center[Here's the audio.

It is a song by the band Dio.

Like many of their songs, it involves a dragon.]
