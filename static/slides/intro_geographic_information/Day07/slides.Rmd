- Rasters are made up of pixels
- Each square in the image to the left represents a single pixel
- All pixels within a raster are always the same size
- We refer to the the length of one side of a pixel as the resolution. So when we say a raster has a resolution of 30 meters, we mean that each pixel is 30m x 30m
- Satellite imagery is the most common form of raster data
