**Alphanumeric Strings**

- Uses letters and or numbers, often simply referred to as a 'string' or 'text'.
- Strings can technically be just numbers, but when you try to use them to do math, they will fail.
- An example would be the join field I mentioned from the U.S. Census which can have leading 0's

**Numbers**
- Integer: No decimal places
   - Short Integer: −32,768 to 32,767
   - Long Integer: −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 **or** from 0 to 4,294,967,295
- Float / Double / Decimal

[These basically refer to different levels of precision:](http://net-informations.com/q/faq/float.html#:~:text=The%20Decimal%2C%20Double%2C%20and%20Float,bit%20floating%20point%20data%20type.)
  - Float is least precise and Decimal is most precise

Understanding data types is one of the more boring, but important things to master within a foundational understanding of GIS. Data types refer to the makeup of different types of data. For example. When you are working in an excel spreadsheet, you can change the settings for a column to show that column as things like a Date, currency, a percentage or others. This is essentially changing the data type of the column and telling excel how to interpret the raw data within each cell. This is the same within GIS. Attached to each vector is an attribute table where all of the attribute data is stored. Each column within the attribute table represents a different attribute and needs to have a data type associated with it. As I mentioned when joining data from the U.S. Census we need a unique identifier to create a tabular join between two sets of features or two tables. Our ability to join two tables together will depend on there being a column in both attribute tables which have identical values that are of the same data type. For example, if I had one table with Census IDs in a column that was an integer type, it would drop the leading 0. If I then tried to join it to another feature that had that same ID filed, but had a string data type, it would retain that leading 0 and the join would fail. Rasters also have data types, which refer to the type of data each cell contains. Integer type rasters are common, such as the National landcover data set but are not precise enough for high resolution elevation data. Higher precision data types mean bigger file sizes which mean longer compute times for analyses. If I were studying a small area near the ocean for example, I could use a smaller file size for elevation data as I would not have any big values. However if I was studying the Rocky Mountains, I would need something larger to account for the large fluctutations in elevation.

|Data type|Storable range|Size (Bytes)|Applications|
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|
|Short integer|-32,768 to 32,767|2|Numeric values without fractional<br> values within specific range; coded values|
|Long integer|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|4|Numeric values without fractional<br> values within specific range|
|Float (single-precision<br> floating-point number)|approximately -3.4E38 to 1.2E38|4|Numeric values with<br> fractional values within specific range|
|Double (double-precision<br> floating-point number)|approximately -2.2E308 to 1.8E308|8|Numeric values with fractional values<br> within specific range|

**Considerations of how you are storing data matter because:**
]
- Smaller files lead to better performace
- But they need to be large enough to handle the data you are using!
- Using the wrong data type can throw a wrench into your analysis and it may not be immediately clear what is wrong.

Here is a simplified table of the numeric data types you are likely to encounter within ArcGIS. As you can see, you might be inclined to think you could just use the most detailed data type and then never worry about it, but consider the effect of quadrupling the size of your files, especially when you might be conducting an analysis over a large geographic area like an entire state or even the whole United States. So when creating data you should always consider your requirements and go with the smallest possible file size. Likewise, it is a good idea to look through data you download from other sources and see if you can't clean it up a bit as you will often come across data that was not produced with these coinsderations. You may also only need a spatial subset of data when downloading a larger database that can be cleaned and made smaller. Getting good at spotting data types and spending a bit of time cleaning your data before you actually start executing complex spatial operations can save you a ton of time down the road both in computation time and headaches over failing tools.

### A Few More Data Types

.med[The Simpler Ones...]


**Boolean**
- TRUE or FALSE (1 bit)

**Dates**

Usually stored in something called PosixCT which as a format like:
  - "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Bit size Varies

**Binaries**

0 or 1 (1 bit)

A few more data types are boolean, which are simply TRUE or FALSE and binaries, which are similar but simply 0 or 1, basically the simplest possible data type. Dates are typically stored in a data type called PosixCT in a format like the one hear. Dates must be properly stored in order to be able to use timeseries data.

## Measurement Scale

.med[

.pull-left[
**Categorical Data**

Nominal - Things that are totally different (cannot be ranked)
- Eye Color
- Last Name

Ordinal - Non-numeric but can be ranked
- Scales like Strongly dissatisfied -> Strongly sattisfied

]

.pull-right[
**Numeric Data**

- Interval: Data that can be quantified but does not refer to an amount, such as temperature or elevation (zero is not meaningful)

- Ratio: Has a meaningful zero. A common example is population density (people per square mile)

- Discrete: Only a certain number of possible values. number of trees in an acre ... number of houses in a square mile etc... 

- Continuous: Infinite possibilities, like tree heights

Measurement scale really comes into play when we are symbolizing attributes or adding aesthetics to a map. The way we visualize our data relies on the scale of the data. For example, the NLCD is categorical data where each pixel represents a discrete land use type. You cannot rank land use types. Farm land does not rank higher than wetland or forest. Therefore you would want to select an appropriate color scale, one with a wide range of colors instead of a continuous color scale. On the other hand, if you were providing someone with a map of temperatures, this would be highly confusing. You would instead want to use a color scale which ranges continuously from blue to red to denote cold to hot. For Ordinal data you may want to use frowny or smiley emojis to show satisfaction levels as colors might be meaningless all together. As opposed to data types, Measurement scale is not really a way of storing data per say. It is more about how you are interpreting and processing the data. Certainly it is possible to alter your measurement scale. For example, you can take Discrete numerical data such as student test scores and convert them to ordinal data by assigning them the grades A, B, C, D, F. Obviously however, you cannot reverse that change so be sure you never are deleting primary data, as you will often change your mind about how to display results or you may make a mistake and need to retrace your steps.

GPS devices come in a variety of shapes and sizes. When GPS was originally created, it was designed for military use and for a long time, the U.S. military introduced intentional accuracy errors fearing that there could be negative outcomes in allowing civilians high accuracy positioning systems. Now however, everyone has access to precision GPS and it's how almost all surveying is done. You may have seen these total station devices in use by construction crews on the side of the road for example. The actual GPS capability may not actually be that much better than your phone, however it does other things as well like range and distance. meaning that it can tell the locations of other places within it's line of site relative to it's position. There are dual-band frequency GPS units which are highly accurate and in use by the military but they are not secret or unobtainable, just really expensive and mostly unnecesarry.
