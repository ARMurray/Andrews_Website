- Do you drink water? (Then you should care!)&lt;br&gt;
.mb[
Example: Mexico City:]
  - 20 million people
  - Aquifer is 100 - 500 m thick
  - Declining at 1-1.5 m per year

So... The aquifer will be dry somewhere between:

paste0(round(100/1.5,1)," years and ", 500/1," years")
```

???
- The high plains aquifer is one of the most utilized aquifers in the united states

20% of irrigated land in the U.S. is in the high plains and 30% of groundwater used for irrigation comes from the high plains aquifer

- the high plains aquifer has declined 4 m between 1950 and 2009 and up to 45m in some places

- declines in groundwater also mean higher energy use in order to pump water greater heights.

- Global groundwater depletion is ~145.4 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (30% of the volume of lake Erie)

##Flow Nets and Natural Basin Yield

.med[
- We construct flow nets to model steady flow in groundwater

- The figure to the right shows a 'curvelinear square' bounded by lines of equipotential and stream lines.

- Discharge in = Discharge out and water cannot cross streamlines

- We use a combination of the conservation of mass and Darcy's law to estimate flow

]

.pull-right[
.med[Recall that areas where water moves downward through the unsaturated zone are areas of recharge and areas where water moves up and out of the ground are areas of discharge

- Remember this is because the **potentiometric surface** (The height to which water rises) may start below the surface and move above the surface.

- Areas of discharge / where the potentiometric surface is above ground are where you would find a stream.
]]

## Flow Nets and Natural Basin Yield
.pull-left[
.med[Take a moment to **really look** at this plot

- At the location of the piezometer, the **elevation head** is 20m

**BUT**
- The **hydraulic head** at that point is 40m because it intersects the 40m line of equipotential

**SO...**

- The **pressure head**, which is `\(p/pg=h-z\)`, is 20m

.med[]
]]
.pull-right[&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
![](FIG7_3.gif)

**Figure 7.3** The hydraulic head along any equipotential is equal to the elevation of its intersection with the water table.

## Flow Nets and Natural Basin Yield

.med[ So let's bring this back to two examples...]
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_2a.png)

- The length of the basin is 100m
- The height of the hill on the right side is 30m
- The difference in hydraulic head betweeen equpotentials is .5m
- The hydraulic conductivity is 0.5m per day
- We will use a value of 1 for `\(b\)`, which is basin width
]

.pull-right[
The equation for specific discharge:

`\(Q_{s}=Kbdh\)`

Apply it to this hillslope:

`\((0.5m/day^{-1})(1m)(0.5m)=0.25m^{3}day^{-1}\)`

**But Wait...** Remember that we are only calculating for 1 streamtube here, so we need to multiply by the number of streamtubes which is based on the interval of lines of equipotential:

There are 4 streamtubes so we multiply by 4!

`\(0.25m^{3}*4=1m^{3}day^{-1}\)`
]
???
- So the basin width is basically adding a 3rd dimension. if the basin was 500m wide we would just multiply by 500
---
## Let's run through an example:
.pull-left[
![](FIG6_11.gif)

Formula: `\(Q_{S}=Kbdh\)`

Conductivity of the soil is `\(10^{-10}m s^{-1}\)` (K)&lt;br&gt;
Distance from one side to the other: `\(100m\)` (b)&lt;br&gt;
Contour Interval for Hydraulic Head: `\(2m\)` (dh)
]

.pull-right[

```r
K &lt;- 10^-10
b &lt;- 100
dh &lt;- 2
Qs &lt;- K*b*dh
Qs
```

```
## [1] 2e-08
```

Mulitply by `\(3\)` because that's how many streamtubes we have:

```r
paste0("Discharge is: ",Qs*3," m^3 s^-1")
```

```
## [1] "Discharge is: 6e-08 m^3 s^-1"
```


```r

## Regional Groundwater Flow
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_4.gif)

**Figure 7.4** The effect of basin aspect ratio (lenght to depth) on natural patterns of groundwater flow. The water-table profile is the same for the shallow (a) and deep (b) basins.
]
.pull-right[
.med[
As you might suspect, groundwater flow may depend on the shape of an aquifer.

a large **aspect ratio** means that the basin is wide and shallow, so a deep basin that is narrow would have a small aspect ratio.

- There is one flaw worth pointing out, which is that soil is more likely to be porpous and less compacted at the surface and less porous and compacted as you descend deeper into the aquifer
]]

### The Effects of Water-Table Topography
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_5.gif)

**Figure 7.5** Regional groundwater flow patterns for the case of local water-table topography. The dashed boxes indicate an individual local flow system. The same equipotential spacing (dh) of 0.003L is used for both the large(a) and small (b) basin aspect ratios.
]
.pull-right[
.med[
Surface topography plays a critical role in water table topography as it provides much of the elevation head driving localized hydraulic gradients.

- A **local flow system** is where water flows from a topographic high to an adjacent low

- Likewise, a **regional flow system** occurs between a regional (non-adjacent) high and low
]]
---
## Regional Groundwater Flow
.pull-left[
.med[
- If local relief is negligible, but a regional water-table slope exists, only a regional flow system will develop.

- Conversely, if local hill-and-valley topography exists, but no regional slope, only local flow systems will develop.

- If both local and regional topography exists in a basin, all three types of flow systems (local, intermediate, and regional) will develop. As a result, precipitation infiltrating on a hilltop may eventually discharge at an adjacent low or follow a longer flow path toward a regional flow point.
]
]
.pull-right[
![](FIG7_6.gif)

**Figure 7.6** Groundwater flow patterns for the case of combines regional and local water-table topography. Streamtubes labeled "L," "I," and "R" indicate the local, intermediate, and regional flow systems, respectively. The same equipotential spacing (dh) of 0.003L is used for both the large (a) and small (b) basin aspect ratios.

### The Impact of Geology
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_8.gif)

**Figure 7.8**
]
.pull-right[
.med[
- So far we have been looking at homogenous aquifers with a known bottom, but geology can really complicate things

- An aquifer at depth speeds up flow due to an increase in conductivity

- An aquitard at depth essentially removes streamtubes and restricts discharge.

- A discontinuous aquifer alters streamtube shape and complicates discharge estimates.

## Water Wells Help Inform Us

What influences recharge?
- Precipitation
- Topography
- Vegetation
- Anything else?

When the water table is close to the surface, what sort of effects can plants have on daily and/or seasonal trends in the water table?

### We Expect Different Behaviors in Wells from Confined and Unconfined Aquifers


.big[Unconfined Aquifers:]
.med[
- In an unconfined aquifer the height of the water in the well should be equal to the water table
- May exhibit daily behaviors but will more likely show seasonal variability
  - Could be due to precipitation regimes or the impacts of (or lack of) evapotranspiration.
- If the water table is really close to the surface, you may see daily changes as transpirational demands directly drive local water table height.

This could also be affected by wether or not the ground freezes.

## Water Content in an Unconfined Aquifer
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_11.gif)

.mb[
**Specific Yield: ** The volume of water that is lost from the aquifer from a `\(1m\)` drop in an area of `\(1m^{2}\)`
]]

.pull-right[
.med[
Consider the figure to the left and think about how water moves through the ground.

- In a cubic meter of soil, there cannot be a cubic meter of water ... that would be a pond!

So how much water is an a cubic meter of soil?
- Is it equal to the pore space?
  - No!

There are forces of adhesion at work within the pore space, so as the water table drops, the soil above the water table does not become immediately 100% dry.

]]
---

##The specific yield determines the response of the water table to changes in inputs and outputs:

.mb[
- Evapotranspiration may affect the position of the water table uniformly over an area.
- Wells on the other hand have affects at specific points.]

.pull-right[
.center[
.mb[
`\(V_{cone}=\frac{V_{pumped}}{S_{y}}\)`
]

Volume of the cone of depression = the volume pumped divided by the specific yield
]]
---
## So What about Confined Aquifers?
.pull-left[
.med[
Remember the **potentiometric surface...**
- In a confined aquifer, you have to consider pressure.
- This means when you remove water from an unconfined aquifer
  - You are lowering the potentiometric surface, but not necesarrily below the confining layer.
  - Therefore the aquifer is still saturated... the actual water level has not decreased. You are only reducing the water pressure within the confined aquifer.
]]
.pull-right[
![](FIG7_12.gif)

## So What about Confined Aquifers?
.pull-left[
.med[
**Storativity: ** The volume of water produced per unit aquifer area per unit decline in the potentiometric surface

**Total Stress: ** The downward force on an object by the overlying layer divided by the area of the plane.

**Effective Stress: **The upward pressure of the aquifer solids + the water pressure

The stresses **MUST** cancel out, otherwise movement would occur.
]]

**Figure 7.12** The storativity of a confined aquifer. For a 1-m decline in the potentiometric surface, the volume of water produced per unit aquifer area is the storativity, S. The aquifer material is not drained and remains saturated.
]

???
But wait... how can you remove water from an unoncfined aquifer and not see the water level decrease? You can't compress water.... so what is happening?
---
.mb[
In general, because water and aquifer materials are not easily compressible, storativity &lt; specific yield

**Storativity** ranges from 0.005 - 0.00005

**Specific Yield** ranges from 0.01 - 0.30

Remember these values are 'unitless' so you can almost think of them as percent.
- For an unconfined aquifer with an area of `\(1m^{2}\)` that drops `\(1m\)`, that means you would have a specific yield of between .01 and .03 `\(m^{3}\)`
]
.med[
A **leaky** aquifer occurs in a semi-confined aquifer. This is where bounding aquitards contribute additional water which may increase storativity.

### Differences Between Confined and Unconfined Aquifer&lt;br&gt;Response to Well Pumping
]
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_14.gif)

]
.pull-right[
**Figure 7.14** The cone of depression in an unconfined **(a)** and confined **(b)** aquifer. The wells are being pumped at a constant rate ( `\(Q_{p}\)` ), and hydraulic heads are being monitored at two piezometers at radial distances `\(r_{1}\)` and `\(r_{2}\)` from the pumping well

Because **specific yield &gt; storativity**, the effects of pumping from a confined and unconfinedd aquifer at the same rate are different. 

- Removing the same amount of water from these two aquifers results in greater lowering of the potentiometric surface than the water table.

- Notice how the wells are drilled into the confined aquifer. The wells are sealed off from the unconfined aquifer, which means the water level in the weell may be different than the water table.
]
???
Atmospheric pressure can exert forces onto the water table.

- In an unonfined aquifer, the pressure is exerted uniformly over the aquifer so water level does not change and water is only slightly compressible.

- In a confined aquifer, atmospheric pressure can actually change the water level inside of a well as the pressure is not exerted over the confined portion of the aquifer.

## Using one well:
.mb[**Slug Test:**]
.med[
In a slug test, you pump a bunch of water out of a well really fast and time how long it takes to come back to normal levels.

`\(Q=2\pi rLK\frac{dh}{dr}\)`

Q is flow into the well, r is the radius of the well, L is the length of the screened portion of the well, K is the hydraulic conductivity


r can vary betweeen `\(R\)` and `\(R_{e}\)` which would be `\(dh\)`

]]

**Figure 7.17** Schematic for slug test. `\(R_{e}\)` is the radial distance beyond which the perturbation by the slug has no effect. Note that the right side of the figure depicts conditions initially, before the slug is removed, and the left side depicts conditions that evolve through time after the slug test is initiated.

## Considering Subsidence 
.pull-left[
![](FIG7_22.gif)

**Figure 7.22** Land Subsidence in Mexico City.
]
.pull-right[
.med[
Think about subsidence in the context of dewatering...

- When water is removed, the effective pressure from the water upward on the overlying surface decreases.
- This increases the downward pressure onto the aquifer leading to compression
- Thus the land surface actually lowers in elevation
- Long term studies need to consider changes in surface elvation and aquifer depth.
  - K values may also change with commpaction.
