### And Now Groundwater Hydraulics...

.left-column[
.med[
Recall the distribution of fresh water on the planet
<br><br>
- Groundwater constitues about 30% of 2.5% (0.75% of total water on earth)
]]

.right-column[
```{r barChart, echo=FALSE, out.height='500px', out.width='600px'}
knitr::include_graphics("EarthsWater-BarChart.png")
```
]
???
- Groundwater lies mostly within soils and rocks, or actually between them, filling their pores.

- Irrigated agriculture all over the world relies on groundwater

- 60% of irrigated grain production in India relies on groundwater

## What Motivates us to Study Groundwater?
]
<br>
.big[
- Groundwater is interesting for several reasons:]
.med[
  - Groundwater feeds perrenial streams so that rivers flow, even without precipitation.
  - It gives us access to water in places where we might otherwise think there is none.
  - We're curious about where rain goes when it makes it to the earth's surface... as we know it does not all run off.
  - Because we use water from the ground, we're curious how contaminants enter groundwater and may get into our drinking water.
