### And Now Groundwater Hydraulics...

.left-column[
.med[
Recall the distribution of fresh water on the planet
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Groundwater constitues about 30% of 2.5% (0.75% of total water on earth)
]]

???
- Groundwater lies mostly within soils and rocks, or actually between them, filling their pores.

- Irrigated agriculture all over the world relies on groundwater

- 60% of irrigated grain production in India relies on groundwater

## What Motivates us to Study Groundwater?
]
&lt;br&gt;
.big[
- Groundwater is interesting for several reasons:]
.med[
  - Groundwater feeds perrenial streams so that rivers flow, even without precipitation.
  - It gives us access to water in places where we might otherwise think there is none.
  - We're curious about where rain goes when it makes it to the earth's surface... as we know it does not all run off.
  - Because we use water from the ground, we're curious how contaminants enter groundwater and may get into our drinking water.

## Henry Darcy

.med[
Henry Darcy was the Inspector General of Bridges and Highways in Dijon, France in the mid-1800's]

![](darcy.png)
.med[
He was part of a team trying to supply water to the town using wells
  - This did not work and he needed an alternative solution
]
]

.pull-right[
![](darcyExperiment.png)
]

???
As a member of the Corps, Henry Darcy built an impressive pressurized water
distribution system in Dijon following the failure of attempts to supply adequate fresh water by drilling wells. The system carried water from Rosoir Spring 12.7 km away through a covered aqueduct to reservoirs near the city, which then fed into a network of 28,000 meters of pressurized pipes delivering water to much of the city. The system was fully closed and driven by gravity, and thus required no pumps with just sand acting as a filter. He was also involved in many other public works in and around Dijon, as well as in the politics of the Dijon city government.

Darcy’s column experiment consisted of a vertical steel column with an inside diameter of 0.35 m and sealed on both ends by bolted flange plates. At the bottom, an outlet reservoir was created by supporting a set of screens above the bottom, which in turn supported the sand. An inlet reservoir was created by leaving a void between the between the sand and the column top. A tap at the top allowed air to be bled from the system. Water flow rate was determined by timing the effluent accumulation in a volumetric box. Supply and effluent lines were mounted on the column side, and both had valves to allow control. Water was supplied directly from the hospital house line, which induced considerable oscillations as users elsewhere turned faucets on and off. Mercury U-tube manometers were connected to both reservoirs to provide pressure measurements. At low-flows they were read to + 1 mm, while at high flow oscillations only allowed reading
to within + 5 mm. Darcy reported this represented knowing the water pressure within
26.2 mm and 1.30 m for low and high flows respectively.

- Change in elevation head could be done simply by tilting the apparatus
- Also could add or remove soil
- Soil was kept inside the tube using screens that were fine enough to keep sand in but allow water to flow freely

## Darcy's Law
.pull-left[
.big[
`\(Q=KA\frac{h_{2}-h_{1}}{L}\)`
]

.med[
`\(Q\)` = Discharge

`\(K\)` = constant of proportionality called hydraulic conductivity

`\(h_{1}\)` = `\(elevation head + pressure head\)` **at the top**

`\(h_{2}\)` = `\(elevation head + pressure head\)` **at the bottom**
]]
.pull-right[
.big[&lt;br&gt;
So what Darcy found was that discharge varies in direct proprtion to *A* and &amp;Delta;h and inverseley with *L*
]]

---
![](darcyExperiment2.png)
---
## The common derivitative which we use in hydrology from Darcy's law (Hornberger Equation 6.6):
.center[
.big[
`\(q=-K\frac{dh}{dl}\)`
]
.med[
Where `\(q=Q/A\)` (specific discharge)
]]

.med[
Here, notice that K has a negative sign, which indicates that a positive specific discharge corresponds with a negative hydraulic gradient.

- Recall that water always wants to move from an area of higher to lower hydraulic head.
]
???
Something to also consider is that we obtained Q from calculating the cross-sectional area, which is technically wrong because water only flows through the pores, not all of the space

.mb[
Here we see experiments conducted for two different types of sand using a variety of different lengths and hydraulic head values
- K (hydraulic conductivity) is the slope of each of the lines.
- The viscosity of fluid also makes a difference, which commes into play with modelling contaminant transport

## Limitations of Darcy's Law:
.big[
1) Invalid under turbulent flow

2) It requires steady-state conditions – no velocity head loss

3) The equation fails at very low values of hydraulic gradient in very low
permeability materials
]
.med[
Hornberger notes that while larger rock types such as crystalline and metamorphic rocks can hardly be envisioned to have capillary tube structures, darcy's law can still be succesffully applied, although this drops off once Reynolds numbers get very high
]
---

## Reynolds Number:
.big[
  Describes the flow of water through a porous medium]
  .med[
  low reynolds number = laminar / sheet like flow
  
  high reynolds number = turbulent flow
  
- Therefore, when the reynolds number is too low, Darcy's law would assume some flow is occuring that may not be because there is not enough inertia to intialize movement (create a tipping point)
]
???
Think back to the example of clays and not allowing the flow of water.

.med[**Aquifer: **"A saturated geological formation that contains and transmits *significant* quantities of water under normal field conditions" ]

???
- "Significant" is a loose term, but the implication is that it is enough to be used as a water source

- Many aquifers are composed of unconsolidated materials like gravel and sand

- Obviously the more porous the material, the more water the aquifer can hold.

- Artesian Well: well from which water flows under natural pressure without pumping, notice the elevation difference in the aquifer.
---
## Artesian Well:

---
###A Few More Definitions:

.pull-left[
.med[
**Aquiclude: ** A formation that may contain water but does not transmit significant quantities

**Aquifuge: **A formation that neither contains nor transmits significant quantities of water

**Aquitard: **The general term most often used to describe formations that are of low permeability and that may include both aquicludes and aquifuges

**Phreatic Surface: ** The water table, defined as a surface of *zero gauge pressure* within the subsurface and seperates the unsaturated and saturated zones.

**Potentiometric Surface: ** The height to which water rises.
]]

.pull-right[
![](FIG6_6.gif)

.small[
**Figure 6.6** Hydrogeological units. Three piezometers are depicted, which are open in either the confined or unconfined aquifer, as indicated by the short horizontal lines. Note that in unconfined aquifers, the water level in the piezometer (far right) indicates the height of the water table; in confined aquifers, the water level in the piezometers (left and center) rises above the top of the aquifer and indicates the position of the potentiometric surface.]
]

???

- Water will rise to the height of the phreatic surface. Remember that the phreatic surface of a confined aquifer may be higher than the unconfined aquifer above it.

### Well Construction:
]
.left-column[
&lt;img src="well.png" width="250px" height="500px" /&gt;
]
.right-column[
.med[
- Wells are constructed in a variety of ways
  - Dug, Auggered, Jetted / Driven
  
- Consideration must be given to:
  - Hydraulic Head
  - Water Table Depth
  - Soil Type
  - Geology
  - Aquifer type
  
  - Wells must be properly screened and cased in ways that reduce vulnerability to contamination while providing sufficient water flow.

## Steady Groundwater Flow
.pull-left[
![](FIG6_7.gif)
]

.pull-right[.center[.big[
`\(h=h_{L}-\frac{q}{K}x\)`&lt;br&gt;.small[(Equation 6.13)]
]]

.med[Head Decreases linearly with distance from the left boundary; that is, the potentiometric surface is a plane sloping from left to right. ]
]

.med[From here, we can begin to draw **equipotential** lines and **streamlines** to construct a **flow net**]

???
So here we are applying Darcy;s law to steady state groundwater flow, which is to say the soil is saturated and it is not changing much (so storage is constant)

- You can see the line drawn to show Potentiometric surface in the confined aquifer, so remember if we punch a hole through the confining layer, this is the level to which the water in the confined aquifer would rise into the unconfined aquifer.

---
## Steady Groundwater Flow Continued:
.pull-left[
.med[**Equipotential: **Lines of equal hydraulic head, constructed by making contour lines from the potentiometric surface

**Stramlines: ** perpendicular lines drawn from equipotential lines to represent the direction of flow within the aquifer.

**Flow net: ** The resulting diagram produced from sketching streamlines
]]
.pull-right[
![](FIG6_8.gif)
]

???

- Darcy's law indicates that flow should always be from high values of hydraulic head to low values, and in fact must follow the path of steepest descent. 

---
## Groundwater Flow is not Horizontal
.pull-left[
.med[
You might think that most of groundwater flow would occur at the water table, but water actually flows throughout the saturated zone

- There is a *U-shaped* quality to the flow of groundwater because of the properties of hydraulic head

**streamtube: ** The area between streamlines. groundwater flow, by definition, canoot cross a streamline.

There is an example in the book where the USGS conducted nitrate testing in an agricultural area and found elevated levels of nitrate at almost every depth they sampled. Highest concentration will not necesarrily be in the shallowest part

---
## Let's run through an example:
.pull-left[
![](FIG6_11.gif)

Formula: `\(Q_{S}=Kbdh\)`

Conductivity of the soil is `\(10^{-10}m s^{-1}\)` (K)&lt;br&gt;
Distance from one side to the other: `\(100m\)` (b)&lt;br&gt;
Contour Interval for Hydraulic Head: `\(2m\)` (dh)
]

b &lt;- 100
dh &lt;- 2
Qs &lt;- K*b*dh

```

```
## [1] 2e-08
```

Mulitply by `\(3\)` because that's how many streamtubes we have:

```r
paste0("Discharge is: ",Qs*3," m^3 s^-1")
```

```
## [1] "Discharge is: 6e-08 m^3 s^-1"
```


```r

```

```
