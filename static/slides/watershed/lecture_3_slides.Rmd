## Outline
- The water balance equation
- Residence time
- Runoff ratio
- Observations
- The watershed as the fundamental unit

## Residence Time

$Tr = \frac{V}{I}$

"Residence time has dimensions of time because volume divided by volume per time is time"

- [T] is time...
  - r refers to the 'residence'
- [V] is volume
- I is inflow

Remember this is at steady state where inflow and outflow rates are identical.

So what are the units...?

## Runoff Ratio

### The proportion of precipitation that becomes runoff

$R_r = \frac{\overline{r_s}}{\overline{p}}$

AKA - How mch rain does not get absorbed by the ground, plants etc...
